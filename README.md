# HyperMatch - Godot VR Demo in C#

A simple VR demo created with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using C#.

The player must pick up and place the correct colour and symbol tiles before the timer runs out.

**Note:** This has been developed and tested using an Oculus Rift CV1 headset and controllers. Running this demo with other headsets/controllers may require changing the buttonIndex values in the _OnControllerButtonPressed(...)_ and _OnControllerButtonRelease(...)_ methods in [Controller.cs](https://github.com/mryderie/hypermatch-godot-vr-csharp/blob/master/Scenes/Scripts/Controller.cs).
